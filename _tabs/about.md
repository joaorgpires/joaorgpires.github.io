Hi, my name is Jo√£o Rebelo Pires and I'm currently working as a Senior Software Engineer at [Devoteam](https://pt.devoteam.com/), working as an outsourcer at [Critical TechWorks](https://www.criticaltechworks.com/). In the past I've worked for Prime Video, Amazon as a Software Developer and Fabamaq, as a Game Developer.

I will write about random thoughts I have on programming, industry and technology in general.

I have an MSc in Computer Science and I have long term experience working with C++. Outside of work I like to play video games, watch TV and sleep. I'm also currently working on my own game engine called Modernas as a side project.

Any opinions in this webpage are mine and my own and do not in any way express the opinion of either my current employer or any of my past employers.
