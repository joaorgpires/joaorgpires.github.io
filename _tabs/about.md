Hi, my name is Jo√£o Rebelo Pires and I'm currently working as a Lead Software Engineer and Scrum Master at [Critical TechWorks](https://www.criticaltechworks.com/) (CTW). In the past I've worked for Prime Video, Amazon as a Software Developer and Fabamaq, as a Game Developer. Prior to working directly for CTW I worked there as an outsourcer (from Devoteam).

I will write about random thoughts I have on programming, industry and technology in general.

I have an MSc in Computer Science and I have long term experience working with C++. Outside of work I like to play video games, watch TV and sleep.

Any opinions in this webpage are mine and my own and do not in any way express the opinion of either my current employer or any of my previous employers.
